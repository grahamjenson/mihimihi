== Mihimihi

This is my mihimihi app (located at [http://mihimihi.maori.geek.nz/](http://mihimihi.maori.geek.nz/)). 
It is written in Ruby on Rails, though it is mostly Sass and CoffeScript, Backbone.js and d3.js.

To host the images I am using an Amazon S3 bucket.

Graham said

I have recently become interested in my familyâ€™s history. I want to know where I am from, who are my ancestors, and what events led me to be here? I have used this Mix & Mash competition as an excuse to answer these questions and research my families history, and I present it as a visual story. I have titled my entry Mihimihi. A mihimihi is a Maori speech where a person gives their whakapapa (genealogy) by describing their iwi (tribe), their hapu (local tribe), their whanau (family) and finishes with an introduction to themselves. The purpose of the mihimihi is to establish links to the people that hear it, as if you go back far enough and include enough people, everyone is linked. My submission is my mihimihi. To establish a link to anyone who reads it, I have started my mihimihi when modern humans first evolved in Africa 200,000 years ago. From there I describe the journeys and some of the challenges my ancestors would have gone through getting from Africa to New Zealand. I introduce my family (as far back as I have found), and finally I introduce myself.. I present this as a description of where I came from, in an attempt to understand who I am. This is the story of my ancestors, my family, and therefore the story of me.

Selected judges comments

"It's powerfully grounding and develops a strong connection between the audience and author. I feel like I know your whole family!"

"This is a huge, well-thought-through, enjoyable project that knits together time and space, encyclopedia and photo album, history and story, to make us rethink the idea of tikanga, the etiquette of introductions, and the location of the self in an electronic age."

"Invoking your ancestors is one thing, but going all the way back to the dawn of humanity? Next level!"
